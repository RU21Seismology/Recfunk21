# Recfunk21
This software package **Recfunk21** (including all necessary shell scripts) is precompiled and provided for doing receriver function analysis using multitaper spectral corrleation estimates. A step-by-step guide is provided together with this package. If you have any questions, please contact Xiaoran Chen (xiaoran.chen@rutgers.edu) or Vadim Levin (vlevin@eps.rutgers.edu).

Relevant background reading: **Park and Levin (2000)** and **Park and Levin (2016a, 2016b)**

**A Practical Guide.pdf** is developed by current and former members of Rutgers Seismology group (Xiaoran Chen, Yiran Li, James Bourke), with contributions from Zhenxin Xie, and encouragement from Prof. Vadim Levin (Rutgers) and code’s author Prof. Jeffrey Park (Yale). It is based on the previous guide to J. Park’s codes by (then) members of Rutgers Seismology group Alex Nikulin and Ben Marshall.

**Instructions** described in this guide include
  1) downloading and using SAC files fetched by PyWEED,
  2) performing initial quality control using Seisgram2K,
  3) running basic receiver function analysis,
  4) running receiver function analysis with harmonic decomposition

### ESSENTIAL NOTE 1: 
This guide will explain how to perform data analysis, but not why this analysis is done, that part is a responsibility of the user.

### ESSENTIAL NOTE 2: 
To get a better idea of what the goals of receiver function analysis are – read the background papers and references therein. To understand what the codes and scripts do to get the analysis done – read them.
